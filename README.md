This repo serves as a future reference for me (or for any interested) on how to create a mesh network with esp32 using espressif. 
This code is a more commented example inspired by the official wifi mesh network [tutorial](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/blob/master/examples/mesh/internal_communication/main/mesh_main.c)

All explanations are provided in the code as comments
